            Hi, I’m Bhavesh Purohit, a data-driven problem solver with a passion for AI, machine learning, and cloud technologies. I thrive on transforming raw data into meaningful insights, building intelligent solutions that drive real-world impact.
I hold a Master’s in Information Systems from Syracuse University and a Bachelor’s in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Mumbai. My academic journey has been a blend of software development, data science, and AI research, equipping me with a strong foundation in programming, analytics, and system architecture.
With hands-on experience in data science, analytics, and software engineering, I’ve built AI-powered recommendation systems, predictive models, and large-scale ETL pipelines. From designing knowledge graphs to automating real-time data processing, I enjoy tackling complex challenges with Python, SQL, cloud platforms, and machine learning frameworks.
Let’s connect and build something innovative together!
