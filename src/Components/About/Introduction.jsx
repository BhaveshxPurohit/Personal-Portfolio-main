            I'm Bhavesh Purohit, a data analyst with 3.5 years of experience turning raw datasets into actionable insights. My expertise lies in building scalable data pipelines, conducting in-depth statistical analysis, and developing interactive dashboards using tools like Power BI, Looker, and Tableau.

At CLAB AI, I worked on a national education platform where I automated data ingestion from AWS S3 to Neo4j, streamlined workflows using Apache Airflow and Spark, and empowered 90+ schools with insight-driven dashboards. Before that, at KPIT Technologies, I led reporting automation for global automotive clients using SQL, Alteryx, and Azure Databricks, reducing data delivery time by over 35%.

I'm also skilled in ETL tools like Informatica and SSIS, and experienced in documenting pipelines and workflows using Confluence and Power Automate, ensuring clarity and continuity across teams.

With a Masterâ€™s in Information Systems from Syracuse University, I bring a blend of technical expertise and business acumen, always striving to make data more accessible, insightful, and impactful for stakeholders.
